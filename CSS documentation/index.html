          <p>Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to simplify the
            process of making web pages presentable.</p>
          <p>CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the text, the
            style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what background images
            or colors are used, layout designs,variations in display for different devices and screen sizes as well as a
            variety of other effects.</p>
          <p>CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML
            document. Most commonly, CSS is combined with the markup languages HTML or XHTML.</p>

        <h1>Why to learn CSS</h1>
        <article>
          <p>CSS is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when
            they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning CSS:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Create Stunning Web site :-</b> CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can
              control the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized
              and laid out, what background images or colors are used, layout designs,variations in display for
              different devices and screen sizes as well as a variety of other effects.</li>
            <li><b>Become a web designer :-</b> If you want to start a carrer as a professional web designer, HTML and
              CSS designing is a must skill.</li>
            <li><b>Control web :-</b> CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides powerful control over the
              presentation of an HTML document. Most commonly, CSS is combined with the markup languages HTML or XHTML.
            </li>
            <li><b>Learn other languages :-</b> Once you understands the basic of HTML and CSS then other related
              technologies like javascript, php, or angular are become easier to understand.</li>
          </ul>

        <h1>Applications of CSS</h1>
        <article>
          <p>As mentioned before, CSS is one of the most widely used style language over the web. I'm going to list few
            of them here:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>CSS saves time :-</b> You can write CSS once and then reuse same sheet in multiple HTML pages. You
              can define a style for each HTML element and apply it to as many Web pages as you want.</li>
            <li><b>Pages load faster :-</b> If you are using CSS, you do not need to write HTML tag attributes every
              time. Just write one CSS rule of a tag and apply it to all the occurrences of that tag. So less code means
              faster download times.</li>
            <li><b>Easy maintenance :-</b> To make a global change, simply change the style, and all elements in all the
              web pages will be updated automatically.</li>
            <li><b>Superior styles to HTML :-</b> CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML, so you can give a
              far better look to your HTML page in comparison to HTML attributes.</li>
            <li><b>Multiple Device Compatibility :-</b> Style sheets allow content to be optimized for more than one
              type of device. By using the same HTML document, different versions of a website can be presented for
              handheld devices such as PDAs and cell phones or for printing.</li>
            <li><b>Global web standards :-</b> Now HTML attributes are being deprecated and it is being recommended to
              use CSS. So its a good idea to start using CSS in all the HTML pages to make them compatible to future
              browsers.</li>
          </ul>

      <section class="main-section" id="Who_creates_and_maintains_CSS">
        <h1>Who Creates and Maintains CSS</h1>
        <article>
          <p>CSS is created and maintained through a group of people within the W3C called the CSS Working Group. The
            CSS Working Group creates documents called specifications. When a specification has been discussed and
            officially ratified by the W3C members, it becomes a recommendation.</p>
          <p>These ratified specifications are called recommendations because the W3C has no control over the actual
            implementation of the language. Independent companies and organizations create that software.</p>
          <p><b>NOTE :-</b> The World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C is a group that makes recommendations about how the
            Internet works and how it should evolve.</p>
        </article>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="CSS_Syntax">
        <h1>CSS Syntax</h1>
        <article>
          <p>A CSS comprises of style rules that are interpreted by the browser and then applied to the corresponding
            elements in your document. A style rule is made of three parts; </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Selector -</b> A selector is an HTML tag at which a style will be applied. This could be any tag like
              &lt;h1&gt; or &lt;table&gt; etc.</li>
            <li><b>Property - </b> A property is a type of attribute of HTML tag. Put simply, all the HTML attributes
              are converted into CSS properties. They could be color, border etc.</li>
            <li><b>Value - </b> Values are assigned to properties. For example, color property can have value either red
              or #F1F1F1 etc.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You can put CSS Style Rule Syntax as follows - </p>
          <pre>
      <code>selector { property: value } </code>
      </pre>
          <p><b>Example -</b> You can define a table border as follows - </p>
          <pre>
      <code>table{ border :1px solid #C00; }</code>
      </pre>
          <p>Here table is a selector and border is a property and given value 1px solid #C00 is the value of that
            property.</p>
        </article>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Type_Selectors">
        <h1>Type Selectors</h1>
        <article>
          <p>This is the same selector we have seen above. Again, one more example to give a color to all level 1
            headings −</p>
          <pre>
      <code>h1 {
        color: #36CFFF;
        } </code>
        </pre>
        </article>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Universal_Selectors">
        <h1>Universal Selectors</h1>
        <article>
          <p>Rather than selecting elements of a specific type, the universal selector quite simply matches the name of
            any element type −</p>
          <pre>
      <code>* {
        color: #000000;
        } </code>
        </pre>
          <p>This rule renders the content of every element in our document in black.</p>
        </article>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Descendant_Selectors">
        <h1>Descendant Selectors</h1>
        <article>
          <p>Suppose you want to apply a style rule to a particular element only when it lies inside a particular
            element. As given in the following example, style rule will apply to &lt;em&gt; element only when it lies
            inside &lt;ul&gt; tag.</p>
          <pre>
      <code>ul em {
        color: #000000;
        } </code>
        </pre>
        </article>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Class_Selectors">
        <article>
          <h1>Class Selectors</h1>
          <p>You can define style rules based on the class attribute of the elements. All the elements having that class
            will be formatted according to the defined rule.</p>
          <pre>
      <code>.black {
        color: #000000;
        } </code>
        </pre>
          <p>This rule renders the content in black for every element with class attribute set to black in our document.
            You can make it a bit more particular. For example −</p>
          <pre>
        <code>
          h1.black {
   color: #000000; 
}   </code>
        </pre>
          <p>This rule renders the content in black for only &lt;h1&gt; elements with class attribute set to black.</p>

          <p>You can apply more than one class selectors to given element. Consider the following example −</p>
          <pre>
        &lt;p class="center bold"&gt;
          This para will be styled by the classes center and bold.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        </pre>
        </article>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="ID_Selectors">
        <h1>ID Selectors</h1>
        <article>
          <p>You can define style rules based on the <em>id</em> attribute of the elements. All the elements having that
            id will be formatted according to the defined rule.</p>
          <pre>
      <code>
      #black {
   color: #000000; 
}
</code>
</pre>
          <p>This rule renders the content in black for every element with id attribute set to black in our document.
            You can make it a bit more particular. For example −</p>
          <pre>
      <code>
      h1#black {
   color: #000000; 
}
</code>
</pre>
          <p>This rule renders the content in black for only &lt;h1&gt; elements with id attribute set to black.

            The true power of id selectors is when they are used as the foundation for descendant selectors, For example
            −</p>
          <pre>
      <code>
      #black h2 {
   color: #000000; 
}
</code>
</pre>
          <p>In this example all level 2 headings will be displayed in black color when those headings will lie with in
            tags having id attribute set to black.</p>
        </article>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Child_Selectors">
        <h1>Child Selectors</h1>
        <article>
          <p>You have seen the descendant selectors. There is one more type of selector, which is very similar to
            descendants but have different functionality. Consider the following example −</p>
          <pre>
      <code>
      body &gt; p {
   color: #000000; 
}
</code>
</pre>
          <p>This rule will render all the paragraphs in black if they are direct child of &lt;body&gt; element. Other
            paragraphs put inside other elements like &lt;div&gt; or &lt;td&gt; would not have any effect of this rule.
          </p>
        </article>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Attribute_Selectors">
        <h1>Attribute Selectors</h1>
        <article>
          <p>You can also apply styles to HTML elements with particular attributes. The style rule below will match all
            the input elements having a type attribute with a value of text −</p>
          <pre>
      <code>
      input[type = "text"] {
   color: #000000; 
}
</code>
</pre>
          <p>The advantage to this method is that the &lt;input type = "submit" /&gt; element is unaffected, and the
            color applied only to the desired text fields.</p>
          <p>There are following rules applied to attribute selector.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>p[lang]</b> − Selects all paragraph elements with a lang attribute.</li>
            <li><b>p[lang="fr"]</b> − Selects all paragraph elements whose lang attribute has a value of exactly "fr".
            </li>
            <li><b>p[lang~="fr"]</b> − Selects all paragraph elements whose lang attribute contains the word "fr".</li>
            <li><b>p[lang|="en"]</b> − Selects all paragraph elements whose lang attribute contains values that are
              exactly "en", or begin with "en-".</li>
          </ul>
        </article>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Grouping_Selectors">
        <h1>Grouping Selectors</h1>
        <article>
          <p>You can apply a style to many selectors if you like. Just separate the selectors with a comma, as given in
            the following example −</p>
          <pre>
      <code>
      h1, h2, h3 {
   color: #36C;
   font-weight: normal;
   letter-spacing: .4em;
   margin-bottom: 1em;
   text-transform: lowercase;
}
</code>
</pre>
          <p>This define style rule will be applicable to h1, h2 and h3 element as well. The order of the list is
            irrelevant. All the elements in the selector will have the corresponding declarations applied to them.</p>
          <p>You can combine the various id selectors together as shown below −</p>
          <pre>
      <code>
      #content, #footer, #supplement {
   position: absolute;
   left: 510px;
   width: 200px;
}
</code>
</pre>
        </article>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Multiple_Style_Rules">
        <h1>Multiple Style Rules</h1>
        <article>
          <p>You may need to define multiple style rules for a single element. You can define these rules to combine
            multiple properties and corresponding values into a single block as defined in the following example −</p>
          <pre>
      <code>
      h1 {
   color: #36C;
   font-weight: normal;
   letter-spacing: .4em;
   margin-bottom: 1em;
   text-transform: lowercase;
}
</code>
</pre>
          <p>Here all the property and value pairs are separated by a <b>semicolon (;)</b>. You can keep them in a
            single line or multiple lines. For better readability, we keep them in separate lines.

            For a while, don't bother about the properties mentioned in the above block. These properties will be
            explained in the coming chapters and you can find complete detail about properties in CSS References.</p>
